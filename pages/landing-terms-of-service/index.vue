          These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
          the Site or in respect to the Site constitute the entire agreement and
          understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce
          any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a
          waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the
          fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our
          rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be
          responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act
          caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
          part of a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be
          unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
          provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not
          affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
          There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
          relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of
          Use or use of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be
